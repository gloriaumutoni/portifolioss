    <h1>RUSIA REJECTS DUTCH COURT RULING ON MH17 PLANE BOMBING</h1>
    <P>The Kremlin government has rejected a Dutch court ruling over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014.

        The court had claimed in its ruling that the bombing of flight MH17 was politically motivated. Russia rejects this assertion and says the court was under “unprecedented pressure”.
        
        Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement that the dutch court was under “unprecedented pressure” from Dutch politicians, prosecutors and media.</P>
<P>“The course and the results of the proceedings indicate that they were based on a political order to reinforce the version promoted by The Hague and its associates,” the foreign Ministry said.

    “We deeply regret that the District Court of The Hague has neglected the principles of impartial justice for the sake of the current political situation, thus inflicting a serious blow to the reputation of the entire judicial system of the Netherlands,” Moscow said.</P>
<P>Moscow said the trial in the Netherlands could go down in history as “one of the most scandalous in the history of legal proceedings with its extensive list of oddities, inconsistencies and dubious arguments of the prosecution.”

    Moscow has also denied all involvement in the crash and has refused to extradite any of the suspects, saying it is illegal under Russian law.</P>
